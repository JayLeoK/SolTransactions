A description on how you would improve upon your design if you had more time:

With more time, I would have liked to design my components to be more reusable. Particularly the table elements could be split up in ways that make it easier to read and refactor.

I have only set up my solana transactions for devnet, but I would like to set up the transactions for mainnet as well, alongside a way for users to switch between the two.

While I tried to make some components accessible, I think it'd be fruitful to do a full accessibility audit and make sure all components follow best practices.

I would also like to utilize a framework for tests to ensure the functionality of the components.

Loading and error states in this application are very basic, and I would like to improve upon them to make them more user friendly. Edge cases between the different transaction types as well as the reconciliation between the database and the blockchain could be analyzed and improved upon.

Interesting component features I could use to improve the crypto wallet experience include a way to quickly copy wallet addresses, blocks, and signatures. Additionally I could also import transactions from solana into the database that were made outside the app.
